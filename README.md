## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Quantum Orchestra up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later)
*   npm (v9 or later)
*   Rust (latest stable, for Tauri backend)
*   Git

### Installation & Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/orquestra-ai/orquestra-qre.git quantum-orchestra
    cd quantum-orchestra
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Rust for the backend (via Tauri) and HTML/JavaScript/CSS for the frontend. The `npm install` command installs development tools like the Tauri CLI, which helps in managing the Tauri application.
    ```bash
    # Install Node.js dev dependencies (e.g., @tauri-apps/cli)
    npm install
    ```
    The Rust dependencies will be compiled when you first run the application.

3.  **Run the application:**
    This command compiles the Rust backend and launches the desktop application, serving the frontend directly.
    ```bash
    # Ensure Rust environment is sourced (if you just installed it)
    # source ~/.cargo/env  # Or your shell's equivalent
    npm run tauri:dev
    ```
    The application window should open automatically. If you make changes to the frontend code (HTML, CSS, JS in the `src` directory), they should be reflected upon a refresh or restart of the app. Changes to the Rust backend will require a restart of the `tauri:dev` command.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Overview: Quantum Resource Estimation

Quantum Orchestra's core is its sophisticated resource estimation engine, found in `src/utils/quantumMetrics.ts`. This engine takes a `QuantumCircuit` definition and a `QuantumArchitecture` model as input and outputs a comprehensive `QuantumResourceEstimation` object.

### Key Metrics Calculated:

*   **Basic Metrics**:
    *   `circuitWidth`: Number of qubits.
    *   `circuitDepth`: Length of the critical path in the circuit.
    *   `gateCount`: Breakdown of gates by type (e.g., H, CNOT, T).
    *   `totalGateCount`: Total number of gates.
*   **Advanced Metrics**:
    *   `quantumVolume`: A holistic benchmark of the quantum computer's capability.
    *   `tGateCount`: Number of T-gates, crucial for fault-tolerant resource estimation.
    *   `swapOverhead`: Estimated number of SWAP gates needed due to limited qubit connectivity.
*   **Time and Coherence**:
    *   `executionTime`: Estimated time to run the circuit on the given architecture (nanoseconds).
    *   `requiredCoherenceTime`: Minimum qubit coherence time needed to run the circuit (microseconds).
    *   `coherenceLimited`: Boolean indicating if the circuit execution is likely limited by qubit coherence times.
*   **Error Analysis**:
    *   `errorRate`: Overall probability of at least one error occurring.
    *   `fidelity`: Overall probability of successful, error-free execution.
    *   `noiseResilienceScore`: A heuristic score (0-1) indicating the circuit's resilience to noise.
*   **Classical Resources**:
    *   `classicalPreprocessingComplexity`: Big O notation for classical computation needed before quantum execution.
    *   `classicalMemoryRequirements`: Estimated classical memory (MB) for simulation or control.
*   **Fault Tolerance (if enabled)**:
    *   `logicalQubitCount`: Number of error-corrected logical qubits.
    *   `physicalQubitCount`: Total physical qubits needed to implement logical qubits using a specified error correction code (e.g., Surface Code).
    *   `errorCorrectionOverhead`: Ratio of physical to logical qubits.
    *   `distanceRequired`: The code distance of the error correction code needed to achieve the target logical error rate.
    *   `resourceStateCount`: Number of magic states (or other resource states) required, often tied to T-gate count.

The engine uses mathematical utilities from `src/utils/mathUtils.ts` for complex number arithmetic and matrix operations, which could be extended for full circuit simulation in the future.

## üß© How to Add New Quantum Providers

Adding a new quantum hardware provider to Quantum Orchestra is designed to be straightforward.

1.  **Define the `QuantumArchitecture`**:
    Create a new `QuantumArchitecture` object in `src/components/QuantumOrchestra.tsx` (or a dedicated provider configuration file in the future). This object should accurately model the hardware's characteristics:
    ```typescript
    const myNewProviderArchitecture: QuantumArchitecture = {
      name: 'My New Quantum Processor',
      qubitCount: 100,
      connectivity: 'grid', // or 'all-to-all', 'linear', etc.
      gateSet: ['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'H', 'CNOT', /* ... other supported gates ... */],
      gateErrors: {
        'single-qubit': 0.0005, 
        'two-qubit': 0.005,
        /* ... specific gate errors ... */
      },
      readoutErrors: [0.01, /* ... per qubit if available ... */],
      t1Times: [150, /* ... per qubit if available ... */], // in microseconds
      t2Times: [70, /* ... per qubit if available ... */],  // in microseconds
      gateTimings: { 
        'single-qubit': 30, // in nanoseconds
        'two-qubit': 200,
        'readout': 1000
      }
    };
    ```

2.  **Add to `quantumProviders` Array**:
    In `src/components/QuantumOrchestra.tsx`, add a new entry to the `quantumProviders` array:
    ```typescript
    const quantumProviders: QuantumProvider[] = [
      // ... existing providers ...
      {
        id: 'my-new-provider',
        name: 'My New Provider Inc.',
        logo: 'my-new-provider-logo.png', // Add logo to public assets
        architecture: myNewProviderArchitecture, // Reference the architecture object
        costPerHour: 150, // Estimated cost
        queueTime: 40,    // Average queue time in minutes
        availability: 90  // Percentage availability
      }
    ];
    ```

3.  **Test**:
    Run the application and verify that your new provider appears in the comparison table and that resource estimations are calculated correctly for its architecture.

Future versions will likely move provider definitions to a separate configuration system or a plugin model for easier management.
