**Orquestra is an advanced, open-source framework for comprehensive quantum resource estimation, simulation management, and cross-provider analysis. Our primary goal is to provide a robust, transparent, and research-grade platform to accelerate the journey towards practical quantum computation.**

The name 'Orquestra' is derived from the Latin word *orchestra* (via Greek ·ΩÄœÅœáŒÆœÉœÑœÅŒ± - orkhƒìstra), historically denoting the space for the chorus in ancient Greek theatre, and later, the ensemble itself. This reflects the platform's role in harmonizing and coordinating the complex array of resources involved in quantum computation.

Orquestra empowers researchers, developers, and organizations to efficiently design, analyze, and plan quantum algorithms by providing deep insights into resource requirements and optimal execution pathways across diverse quantum hardware models.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Advanced Resource Estimation**: Go beyond basic gate counts with metrics like Quantum Volume, T-gate overhead, SWAP analysis, and execution time predictions.
*   **Fault-Tolerance Analysis**: Estimate resources for error-corrected quantum computing using Surface Codes, including physical qubit overheads and logical gate cycle times.
*   **Detailed Hardware Modeling**: Define and compare custom quantum hardware architectures with precise parameters for qubits, connectivity, error rates, and timings.
*   **Interactive Desktop Application**: A user-friendly Tauri (Rust + TypeScript/React) application for circuit design, estimation, and provider comparison.
*   **Python SDK**: Programmatic access to Orquestra's estimation engine for integration into research workflows and hardware provider tools.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation**: In-depth technical papers covering conceptual foundations, algorithms, and validation, suitable for academic use.
