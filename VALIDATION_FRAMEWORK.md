# Quantum Orchestra: Validation Framework

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive validation framework for the Quantum Orchestra platform. The primary goal of this framework is to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of the quantum resource estimation algorithms and results produced by Quantum Orchestra. Validation is critical for establishing trust in the platform's outputs, supporting its use in academic research, and guiding practical quantum computing endeavors.

This framework encompasses a multi-faceted approach, including:
*   Testing against known benchmarks and analytical results.
*   Cross-validation with other established tools and published literature.
*   Rigorous regression testing to maintain stability.
*   Performance analysis of the estimation algorithms themselves.
*   Specific validation strategies for core components like error propagation, fault-tolerance calculations, and hardware modeling.

## 2. Test Circuit Library

A curated library of test circuits is essential for systematic validation. This library will include circuits with varying characteristics:

*   **Small, Analytically Solvable Circuits**:
    *   Bell State preparation (2 qubits, 2 gates): Validate depth, gate counts.
    *   GHZ State preparation (N qubits): Validate scaling of depth and gate counts.
    *   Simple Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) (2, 3, 4 qubits): Known structure and gate counts.
    *   Teleportation circuit (3 qubits): Known gate sequence.
*   **Standard Quantum Algorithm Kernels**:
    *   Grover's search oracle for small N.
    *   Phase estimation circuit for simple unitaries.
    *   Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) ansatz for small molecules (e.g., H2, LiH) with few qubits.
*   **Randomized Circuits**:
    *   Random Clifford circuits: Useful for testing components that behave differently for Clifford vs. non-Clifford operations.
    *   Random SU(4) circuits for Quantum Volume model testing.
    *   Circuits with varying depths, widths, and gate densities.
*   **Connectivity-Challenging Circuits**:
    *   Circuits requiring many non-local two-qubit gates to stress SWAP estimation.
    *   Example: A fully connected graph of CNOTs on N qubits.
*   **Fault-Tolerance Test Circuits**:
    *   Simple logical operations (e.g., logical X, Z, H, CNOT) encoded using the Surface Code.
    *   Circuits with a known number of T-gates to test magic state factory estimations.
*   **Published Benchmark Suites**:
    *   Subsets from QASMBench, RevLib, or other relevant academic benchmark collections, translated into Quantum Orchestra's circuit format.

**Management**:
*   Circuits will be stored in a structured format (e.g., JSON, QASM if import supported).
*   Each circuit will have associated metadata:
    *   Source/reference.
    *   Known analytical properties (e.g., exact depth, gate counts, expected fidelity under ideal conditions).
    *   Published resource estimates if available.

## 3. Cross-Validation Strategies

Comparing Quantum Orchestra's outputs with external sources is crucial for identifying discrepancies and building confidence.

*   **Against Other QRE Tools**:
    *   **Tools**: Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK) Resource Estimator, Qiskit's built-in estimators (e.g., `BackendEstimator`), Classiq platform (if accessible), academic research tools.
    *   **Methodology**:
        1.  Select a common set of benchmark circuits from the library.
        2.  Define equivalent hardware architecture parameters across tools (as closely as possible).
        3.  Run estimations on all tools.
        4.  Compare key metrics: qubit counts, gate counts (total and by type), circuit depth, T-gate count, estimated execution time, fidelity, and fault-tolerant resource (if applicable).
        5.  Analyze discrepancies: Document differences, investigate underlying model assumptions in each tool that might lead to variations.
*   **Against Published Research**:
    *   **Sources**: Peer-reviewed papers that provide detailed resource estimates for specific algorithms on defined architectures (e.g., Gidney & Eker√• for Shor's algorithm, various papers on quantum chemistry simulations).
    *   **Methodology**:
        1.  Replicate the circuit and architecture described in the paper within Quantum Orchestra.
        2.  Compare Quantum Orchestra's estimates with the published results.
        3.  Document any assumptions made to match the paper's model.
*   **Against Experimental Data (Future Goal)**:
    *   As experimental data from real quantum hardware becomes more accessible and detailed, compare estimated fidelities or execution times with actual observed values for small benchmark circuits. This is challenging due to the difficulty in perfectly matching experimental noise models.

## 4. Mathematical Validation Tests

For certain algorithms and simple circuit configurations, analytical results or easily verifiable properties exist.

*   **Circuit Depth**:
    *   Test: For a linear chain of CNOTs on $N_q$ qubits, depth should be $2N_q-3$ (or similar, depending on CNOT definition).
    *   Test: For $N_q$ parallel Hadamard gates, depth should be 1.
*   **Gate Counts**:
    *   Test: Verify exact gate counts for manually constructed small circuits.
*   **SWAP Overhead**:
    *   Test (Shortest-Path): For a CNOT between qubit 0 and $N_q-1$ on a linear chain of $N_q$ physical qubits, SWAP overhead should be $N_q-2$.
    *   Test (All-to-all): SWAP overhead should always be 0 for an all-to-all connected architecture.
*   **Fidelity Estimation**:
    *   Test: For a circuit with one gate of error $\epsilon$, fidelity should be $1-\epsilon$.
    *   Test: For two independent gates with errors $\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2$, fidelity should be $(1-\epsilon_1)(1-\epsilon_2)$.
*   **Fault Tolerance (Surface Code)**:
    *   Test: For $P_p \ge P_{th}$, code distance $d$ should be $\infty$ (or a very large number indicating infeasibility).
    *   Test: For $P_p \ll P_{th}$, code distance $d$ should approach the minimum (e.g., 3) for reasonable $P_{L,target}$.
    *   Test: Verify physical qubit count $2d^2$ (or chosen formula) for a given $d$.

**Implementation**: These tests will be implemented as unit tests within the testing framework, comparing function outputs against expected values for specific inputs.

## 5. Regression Testing Framework

A robust regression testing suite is vital to ensure that code changes do not inadvertently break existing functionality or alter validated estimations in unexpected ways.

*   **Framework**: Utilize a standard testing framework like Jest (for TypeScript/JavaScript components) or Python's `unittest`/`pytest` (if core algorithms are in Python).
*   **Test Cases**:
    *   All mathematical validation tests (Section 4).
    *   A representative subset of the Test Circuit Library (Section 2) with "golden" estimation results stored. Golden results are previously validated outputs for specific circuit-architecture pairs.
    *   Edge case tests: empty circuits, circuits with 1 qubit, circuits exceeding physical qubit limits, unsupported gates for an architecture.
*   **Execution**:
    *   Automated execution on every commit/pull request via CI (Section 10).
    *   Periodic full regression runs.
*   **Failure Analysis**:
    *   If a regression test fails, the corresponding change must be investigated.
    *   If the new result is more accurate (due to model improvement), the "golden" result must be updated with justification.
    *   If the new result is incorrect, the change must be reverted or fixed.

## 6. Performance Benchmarking Protocols

This involves benchmarking the performance of Quantum Orchestra's *estimation algorithms themselves*, not the quantum circuits they analyze.

*   **Metrics**:
    *   Execution time of `estimateAllQuantumResources` and its sub-functions.
    *   Memory usage during estimation.
*   **Methodology**:
    1.  Select circuits of increasing size (number of qubits $N_q$, number of gates $G$).
    2.  Run estimations multiple times for each circuit to average out system noise.
    3.  Record execution time and peak memory usage.
    4.  Analyze how these metrics scale with $N_q$ and $G$.
    5.  Identify performance bottlenecks in the estimation code.
*   **Tools**: Profiling tools appropriate for the language (e.g., Chrome DevTools for Node.js/TS, cProfile/Pyinstrument for Python).
*   **Goals**: Ensure estimation remains practical for large, complex circuits relevant to future quantum computers. Set performance targets (e.g., estimation for a 1000-qubit, 1M-gate circuit should complete within X seconds).

## 7. Error Propagation Analysis Validation

Validating the models used for estimating circuit fidelity and error rates.

*   **Component Tests**:
    *   Test individual gate error contributions to total fidelity.
    *   Test readout error contributions.
    *   Test the impact of the heuristic decoherence factor.
*   **Small-Scale Noisy Simulation**:
    *   For very small circuits (e.g., 2-5 qubits), use a quantum simulator (e.g., Qiskit Aer with noise models, QuTiP) to perform state-vector or density matrix simulations with defined gate errors and decoherence channels (T1, T2).
    *   Compare the simulated final state fidelity or process fidelity with Quantum Orchestra's `circuitFidelity` estimate.
    *   This requires careful mapping of Quantum Orchestra's error parameters to the simulator's noise model parameters.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis**:
    *   Vary individual error parameters in `QuantumHardwareArchitecture` (e.g., CNOT error rate) and observe the change in estimated `circuitFidelity`.
    *   Ensure the sensitivity aligns with the expected impact (e.g., higher CNOT error should decrease fidelity more for CNOT-heavy circuits).

## 8. Fault Tolerance Calculation Validation

Specific tests for the FTQC resource estimation, particularly for the Surface Code model.

*   **Code Distance Calculation**:
    *   Verify the formula $d \approx 2 \cdot \frac{\log(P_{L,target}/A)}{\log(P_p/P_{th})} - 1$ against manual calculations for various $P_p, P_{L,target}$ values.
    *   Ensure $d$ is correctly rounded up to the nearest odd integer and respects minimums.
*   **Physical Qubit Count**:
    *   Verify $N_{P,total} = N_L \cdot (\text{PHYSICAL\_PER\_LOGICAL\_FACTOR\_FUNC}(d)) \cdot \text{ROUTING\_OVERHEAD\_FACTOR}$.
*   **Logical Gate Time**:
    *   Verify $T_{cycle,log} \approx (\text{LOGICAL\_CYCLE\_TIME\_FACTOR\_VS\_PHYSICAL\_GATE}(d)) \cdot T_{gate,phys}$.
*   **Comparison with FTQC Literature**:
    *   Use established FTQC resource estimation papers (e.g., Fowler et al., Gidney & Eker√•) as benchmarks.
    *   Replicate their assumptions for $P_p$, $P_{L,target}$, T-factory models (if possible), and physical gate times.
    *   Compare Quantum Orchestra's estimates for $d$, $N_{P,total}$, and $T_{exec,log}$ for benchmark algorithms like Shor's.
*   **T-Factory Model Validation (Future)**:
    *   If more detailed T-factory models are implemented (e.g., specific distillation protocols), validate their space-time volume estimates against specialized literature.

## 9. Provider Architecture Accuracy Validation

Ensuring the `QuantumHardwareArchitecture` models are representative.

*   **Publicly Available Data**:
    *   For providers like IBM Quantum, Google Quantum AI, Rigetti, IonQ, etc., cross-reference `qubitCount`, `connectivity`, `nativeGateSet`, average `gateErrors`, `readoutErrors`, `t1Times`, `t2Times`, and `gateTimings` with information published on their websites, research papers, or SDKs (e.g., Qiskit `backend.properties()`).
*   **Consistency Checks**:
    *   Ensure `nativeGateSet` aligns with the gates for which `gateErrors` and `gateTimings` are provided.
    *   Ensure array lengths for per-qubit parameters (e.g., `readoutErrors`, `t1Times`) match `qubitCount` if not providing a single average.
*   **Community Input**:
    *   Allow users to report discrepancies or suggest updates to architecture parameters based on new information or their experiences.
*   **Versioning**:
    *   Consider versioning architecture models, as hardware specifications evolve rapidly.

## 10. Statistical Analysis Methods for Validation

When comparing Quantum Orchestra's outputs with experimental results or outputs from stochastic simulation methods, statistical rigor is needed.

*   **Mean and Confidence Intervals**: When comparing against multiple runs of a noisy simulator or experimental data, calculate mean values and confidence intervals for key metrics. Check if Quantum Orchestra's deterministic estimate falls within these intervals.
*   **Hypothesis Testing**:
    *   Formulate null hypotheses (e.g., "There is no significant difference between Quantum Orchestra's estimated fidelity and the mean fidelity from noisy simulations").
    *   Use appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-test, chi-squared test for distributions) to evaluate these hypotheses.
*   **Correlation Analysis**:
    *   Measure the correlation (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient) between Quantum Orchestra's estimates and results from other tools/experiments across a range of circuits.
*   **Residual Analysis**:
    *   Plot residuals (differences between Quantum Orchestra's estimates and benchmark values) to identify systematic biases or trends.

## 11. Continuous Integration (CI) Testing Strategies

Automated testing within a CI/CD pipeline is crucial for maintaining quality and reliability.

*   **Pipeline Setup**: Use platforms like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
*   **Triggers**:
    *   Run a fast subset of tests (e.g., core unit tests, small regression suite) on every commit to a development branch.
    *   Run the full validation suite (including longer regression tests and cross-validation stubs) on every pull request to the main branch and before releases.
*   **Test Stages**:
    1.  **Linting & Static Analysis**: Check code quality and style.
    2.  **Unit Tests**: Execute mathematical validation tests and component tests for individual functions.
    3.  **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between different modules (e.g., circuit parser with estimation engine).
    4.  **Regression Tests**: Compare outputs against golden datasets.
    5.  **(Optional/Periodic) Performance Tests**: Track estimation algorithm performance over time.
    6.  **(Manual/Semi-Automated) Cross-Validation Stubs**: Scripts that can fetch/run other tools for comparison, with results manually reviewed or threshold-checked if possible.
*   **Reporting**:
    *   Clear reporting of test successes and failures.
    *   Code coverage reports.
    *   Notifications for build/test failures.
*   **Artifacts**: Store test reports and coverage data.

By implementing this comprehensive validation framework, Quantum Orchestra aims to provide a trusted, accurate, and academically sound platform for quantum resource estimation. This framework will be a living document, evolving as the platform and the field of quantum computing advance.
